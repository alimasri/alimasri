ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alimasri. I am a Lead Data Engineer at Ford Motor Company. In my day-to-day job, I work with data engineers, data scientists and business customers to build big data products. These products help the company extract valuable insights, make faster decisions, and save a lot of money. I have 7+ years of IT experience, in the domains of Data Science and Data Engineering. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the University of Paris Saclay in France. My thesis was about building an integration solution that connects different transportation systems in the area of Paris. During my research, I published many articles in national and international conferences. I really like teaching and writing about Data Science and Data Engineering. I have been leading many enterprise data science training programs that enable people with different backgrounds to understand and use current data science tools.
