ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @alimasri. I am an AI and Data Engineer at Ford Motor Company. In my day-to-day job, I collaborate with data engineers, data scientists, and business customers to build innovative big data and AI products. These solutions help the company extract valuable insights, make faster decisions, and drive significant cost savings.
With over 9 years of IT experience spanning Data Science, Data Engineering, and AI, I bring a comprehensive skill set to tackle complex challenges. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the University of Paris Saclay in France, where my thesis focused on developing an integration solution for connecting diverse transportation systems in the Paris area.
I'm passionate about teaching and writing on Data Science, Data Engineering, and AI technologies. I've led multiple enterprise-level training programs, empowering professionals from various backgrounds to understand and leverage current data science and AI tools.
In my current role, I combine my expertise in big data architectures with machine learning and AI techniques to create scalable, intelligent systems. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of data engineering and AI, exploring ways to optimize data pipelines for machine learning workflows and implement AI-driven data processing solutions.
